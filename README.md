# obs_auxTel
This fork of obs_auxTel will form the backbone for obs_superbit!
Based on the recommendation of Simon Krughoff, so blame him

We chose to base our development on this repository because of the similarity between the auxTel detector
and the SuperBIT detector.

Updates will be posted here as we make them!
